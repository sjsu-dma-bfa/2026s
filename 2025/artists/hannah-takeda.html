      <h2>About the Artist</h2>
      <p>
        Hannah Takeda is a Japanese-American multimedia artist based in the Bay Area of California. Currently in her fourth year at San José State University, she explores a wide range of artistic media, including digital and traditional illustration, photography, and video editing. Her work reflects a curiosity for growth and a deep appreciation for creativity in all its forms.
        Hannah primarily works in Procreate, occasionally incorporating Adobe Premiere Pro and Adobe Lightroom for her digital projects. In photography, she uses her Nikon camera to capture the beauty of the world around her. Photography holds a special place in her heart, as it was a passion passed down from her father and older sister. Her father’s love for documenting life’s moments inspired Hannah’s own desire to capture and share beauty through her lens.
        Her inspirations come from her family, nature, anime, and the hobbies and lifestyle that shape her daily life. Whether it’s spending time outdoors, engaging with her favorite shows and games, or exploring new creative outlets, Hannah draws from the things she loves most. Her hobbies naturally become sources of creative energy, fueling her imagination and shaping the themes within her work. Each project reflects pieces of her personal world: her interests, memories, and the simple joys that inspire her to keep creating.
        Hannah continues to explore new materials and techniques, embracing every opportunity to expand her creative horizons. She hopes that her art not only expresses her personal growth but also inspires others to pursue their passions, experiment freely, and spread positivity through creativity.

      <p>Pixel Heart is a nostalgic yet reflective piece that reimagines the early 2000s digital pet toy as a reminder of self-care. Shaped like a Tamagotchi, the mirror invites viewers to see themselves as the “pet” inside, turning what was once a digital act of caretaking into a personal reminder to nurture ourselves.
        When I was a child, taking care of a Tamagotchi meant feeding it, cleaning up after it, and giving it attention throughout the day. Even though it was just a pixelated creature, it needed patience and consistency, something we often forget to give ourselves as adults. This project flips that idea. Instead of caring for a digital friend, the viewer becomes the one who needs care.
        The piece features small decals inspired by the toy’s buttons. Designed with early 2000s materials, it feels playful yet meaningful, a mix of nostalgia and reflection. In a world where we give so much attention to our devices, Pixel Heart asks us to pause and give some of that care back to ourselves.
