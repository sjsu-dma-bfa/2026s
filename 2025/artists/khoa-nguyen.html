      <p>Hello! I hope that your day is going well!

        I'm Afraid is a one-to-two-minute short film of a student being haunted by the physical manifestation of anxiety. If you’re going through it right now while reading this, you are heard, and your feelings are valid!
        
        Walking into this project, I knew that I wanted to do something about fear and the feeling that something is always going to go wrong. 
        
        Growing up in a Vietnamese family in South Vietnam, the concept of mental health and stress was practically non-existent in my life. That of course caused a lot of built-up issues that then proceeded to explode during the pandemic lockdown from 2020 to 2021 and my transition into becoming a college freshman at SJSU. Luckily, I was able to get through it by going to therapy, watching a ton of horror movies, and my being with friends.
        
        If people are going to get anything out of this, I hope that they walk away knowing that their worries are valid and that there is always somebody who is willing to listen.</p>
