      <h2>About the Artist</h2>
      <p>Benjamin Lee is a Bay Area-based artist and a Bachelor of Fine Arts student at San José State University, graduating in the spring of 2026. Growing up immersed in comics, cartoons, anime, and video games, he was captivated by their vibrant storytelling, dynamic action, and striking visuals. These early influences sparked his passion for creation, leading him to experiment with everything from Legos and papier-mâché to pipe cleaner action figures.

At SJSU, Benjamin has expanded his artistic practice, exploring a wide range of mediums, including crochet, sculpture, and digital media. His work often reflects his love for storytelling and visually compelling narratives, aiming to create pieces that are not only fun and cool but also invite viewers to share in his personal joy and enthusiasm for life.

Through his art, Benjamin seeks to break free from societal expectations and labels, focusing instead on creating work that is authentic and meaningful to him. Whether it’s a crochet installation or a playful homage to his favorite media, his goal is to inspire others to embrace their own creativity and find beauty in the unexpected</p>

      <p>I’m an artist. I’m an artist. I’m an artist. I’m an artist. I’m an artist. …Right?
This mantra echoes in my mind, a constant reminder of the identity I’ve been assigned—one that comes with expectations, assumptions, and pressure. “You’re an artist, right? Can you draw something for us?” These questions, though seemingly harmless, weigh heavily on me. They reduce my identity to a skill set, something to be performed on demand. But being an artist is more than that. Or at least, it should be.

As I navigate my digital media art major, I often feel like a sham. My classmates and peers speak eloquently about the deep meanings behind their work, while I struggle to articulate why I create. The truth is, I don’t always have a profound message. I just want to make things that look cool, things that are visually appealing to me. Yet, the stigma of being an artist—of needing to be “artsy” and have deep, intellectual meaning—leaves me feeling out of place, as if my approach isn’t valid.

My work is a rebellion against these constraints. Through a crochet web, I visualize the struggle of breaking free from the identity of an “art person.” A hand bursts through, reaching for something personal and comforting—a simple doodle I’ve drawn since childhood or a crochet plushie inspired by the media I love, like My Dress-Up Darling or One Punch Man. These objects represent my true creative desires: to make what I love, without the weight of labels or expectations.

This project is a culmination of the art and craft techniques I’ve learned over time, blending crochet, sculpture, and personal symbolism into a single, thought-provoking piece. It’s a reflection of my journey as an artist—a journey not defined by what others expect, but by what I find meaningful and authentic.

I’m an artist. Not because I can draw on demand or explain the “deeper meaning” behind every piece. But because I create for myself, and that’s enough.</p>
