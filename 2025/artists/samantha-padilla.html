      <p>A bandaid is temporary. It feels reassuring in the moment, but over time it begins to peel—losing its purpose. This is how hospitals often treat women’s health: offering quick fixes instead of searching for the root cause of pain. With this piece, I invite you to participate in diagnosing the woman on the wall. Each bandaid represents a dismissal, a temporary fix, a failure to listen. Ask yourself: does covering the problem ever heal or does it reveal the cracks in our healthcare system?</p>
