      <p>Ashes to Bloom explores the cycles of life, death, and rebirth through a blend of physical sculpture and digital projection. The work reflects on impermanence—how beauty, vitality, and decay are all connected parts of existence. The installation features sculpted skulls mounted on canvas, brought to life with projection-mapped animations that move through three stages: growth, decay, and renewal. In a world marked by uncertainty and loss, the piece offers a quiet reflection on renewal, inviting viewers to see death not as an end, but as part of a continuous cycle of transformation.</p>
