      <h2>About the Artist</h2>
      <p>Justin Kim is a digital artist who was born and raised in San Jose, California, and is in his final steps of completing his bachelor of fine arts degree at San Jose State University. He’s been focusing on video production since late 2018 and his work focuses on mainly comedic and informative content based off of other forms of media and content he’s been exposed to, and interested in, throughout his life. Over the years, he developed his current style of content and art creation through different guides and internet trends that inspired, and molded, his view of what content creation should look like.</p>

      <p>Cosmic Collectibles is my take on the soaring obsession and infatuation that scalpers and fans alike have with collectible Pokémon cards but in a “videogame” format. It’s a video animation piece of a videogame of sorts where I want people to see the designs I’ve made for these cards, my skills as an animator using Adobe After Effects, and also the way I have incorporated the many friends I’ve made at SJSU into my piece. I’m leaning into my comfort zone and am finally using my greater knowledge of video editing to use. Using computer software to create the artworks, like Clip Studio Paint and Photoshop, I intend to show you all a glimpse into what my creative world looks like.</p>
