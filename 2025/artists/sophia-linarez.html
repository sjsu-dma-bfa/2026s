      <p>Beatrix's World is my take on many different topics such as internet dependence , isolation, and the loser girl aesthetic. We now live in a time where we have an insane amount internet access and there are a million things you can do. With so much to explore there comes a point where it can be unhealthy and we begin to become disconnected from real life. This then leads to isolation and finding comfort online because forming connections online is much easier then in real life. It's become so normalized as well that in a way it becomes romanticized , hence where my loser girl comes in. My character , Beatrix, is meant to embody that exact feeling and how she struggles with wanting to change but its hard when you choose to isolate yourself and believe no one wants to help you. Its a cautionary tale and it up to players to choose what they believe is the right choice for her to either escape or let the cycle continue.</p>
