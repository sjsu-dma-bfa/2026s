      <p>This piece follows a child experiencing major inflection points of life where change is inevitable: childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. However, how those changes take shape is left in the hands of the viewers through their votes, the embodiment of the external voices that inform our choices. This interaction mirrors how our identity is formed, through the ongoing dialogue between what we want and what the world wants from us. The depiction of events and the artwork is minimalistic, where essential moments are captured over complete stories, much like the character design method of "show don't tell". Overall, it celebrates that who we become is shaped as much by the paths we took as the ones we left behind.</p>
