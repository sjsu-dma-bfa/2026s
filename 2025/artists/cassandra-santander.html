      <h2>About the Artist</h2>
      <p>Cassandra Santander is a Mexican-American digital artist residing in the Bay Area specializing primarily in 2D illustration and a healthy mix of other mediums, such as HTML coding and 3D modeling. Ever since discovering her love for art and creation during her elementary years, her passion's driving forces are her strong friendships, for whom she takes in their infectious energies, and the curiosity to learn different creative processes. Her artwork is imbued with her sentimentality behind her subjects, intending to connect with her audience and share in these feelings. When she is away from her computer, she dabbles in propmaking and needlework. She is currently pursuing a Bachelors of Fine Arts at San Jose State University.</p>

      <p>Loneliness is not something that easily goes away and while it is as normal as any other human emotion, it still has a particular sting that likes to stay weaved in the mind. You can feel like you're in a good place and that you're doing fine, yet it can take one simple mishap for the feeling to come back and pull you back into a bad mindspace. 

"Out of Place" is a 2D-3D hybrid video project about this thread of loneliness that has been intertwined with me throughout my life, winding from my childhood to today as an adult. The video is separated into three different segments. The first two segments represent two different parts of my life where the feeling was particularly strong, both as a child and now as an adult. The last segment is meant to show that even when the feeling has gotten powerful enough to be suffocating, it ultimately comes and goes in waves that become easier to bear alongside loved ones.

At some point in their lives, everyone has felt loneliness at least once. I hope people will always get the chance to experience the connection that comes after.</p>
