      <p>Leo Yan is a Chinese-American artist based in the Bay Area that works primarily in the digital 3D field to make environments, bringing his personal and unique ideas to life. He is mainly inspired by the video games he used to play when he was younger due to the immersive worlds and designs they offered. In his work, he creates environments and spaces that evoke similar feelings that he experienced when playing video games as a kid.

      <p>Between Past and Present, is a personal project that dives deep into my life and reflects themes including my memories and change I experienced as I grew up. With the use of 3D modeling as my medium, I want to show how my bedroom, a space where I had countless memories in, can shift and transform as I did.

This project reflects my growth from a joyful and innocent childhood to a rather complex and the reality of adulthood which included hardships. A few of the hardships included being more independent, having responsibilities, and facing struggles. As a child, the world felt more simple and carefree with less responsibilities and struggles that I had to worry about. But as I grew older, I realized that adulthood also comes with many expectations.

Through this project, I hope for the audience to also reflect on their own spaces and the ways they have evolved through time. Our living spaces contain pieces of memories that show who we are and how we have grown. By displaying these changes through my personal life, I hope to express a sense of nostalgia and encourage others to reflect on how their personal spaces hold memories that have shaped their growth and identity.</p>
