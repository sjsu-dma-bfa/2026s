      <h2>About the Artist</h2>
      <p>Dat Ngo is a digital artist studying at San José State University. He first discovered his passion for digital art in high school, where he fell in love with blending code and creativity to bring his ideas to life.

     His work draws inspiration from pop culture, internet culture, and nostalgia, exploring how technology shapes identity and self-expression. Playful, experimental, and often a bit chaotic, Dat’s art reflects whatever fascinates him in the moment, turning spontaneous curiosity into visual storytelling.

     He believes the best work happens when creativity is approached with a sense of fun but still treated with genuine care. For Dat, it is about finding the balance between craft and chaos, where technical skill meets imagination and authenticity.</p>

      <p>  Eira is an interactive AI chatbot and virtual art critic that blends VTuber streaming culture with thoughtful art commentary. The project explores how artificial intelligence, digital performance, and cultural critique can come together to create a virtual personality delivering art analysis through the lens of internet culture. Eira asks whether AI can bridge academic art discourse with more open, entertaining conversation. Speaking as a witty, straightforward streamer, she challenges the formality of traditional art discussions, making them more engaging and personal.

     Technically, Eira runs on a layered system using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the interface, a VRM avatar for expressive animation, and a Python-based AI for personality-driven dialogue. Voice synthesis and recognition enable real-time interaction, giving her a lively, natural presence. Her design contrasts the calm of an art gallery with the chaos of online streaming, reflecting the tension between tradition and digital culture.

     As both a conceptual artwork and a cultural experiment, Eira explores what authenticity and expertise mean in the digital age. Whether she’s discussing Caravaggio or the storytelling of video games, she treats every creative form as worthy of serious attention. Through her voice and personality, Eira invites audiences to consider how technology, emotion, and knowledge shape the way we experience art.</p>
