      <h2>About the Artist</h2>
      <p>My name is Alejandro Maciel. I am a Digital Media Art major at San Jose University, wanting to specialize in 3D modeling and 3D character creation. My projects are deeply inspired by my absolute love for world building, and 3D is the perfect medium for me to be able to break the boundaries of reality.

I grew up in Stockton, California; besides its high crime rate, it's not really known for much else. I am a first-generation, gay, Hispanic artist, and the only reason I've been able to get to where I am today is because of my family's legacy of sacrifice. My parents have worked tirelessly to give me opportunities that they never even thought were feasible. That legacy that they have instilled upon me is very dear to my heart and has inspired me to pursue what I really want to do as a way of honoring my heritage.

I know that this field relies heavily on technical skill, but I believe that my unique perspective allows me to explore character design in a way that celebrates difference and inclusivity in a way that's actually productive. I'm interested in creating characters that resonate with themes of identity and transformation but that don't feel forced. I'm often noted that in this industry a lot of these characters seem to be forcibly included to add to a checklist to ensure that what's being created seems inclusive. I want to completely break this standard and instead create characters that are immersive and that actually feel as though they have multiple facets to them.

While I'm still pretty early on my journey, I'm learning how to use new tools and techniques and challenging myself to have the technical precision that can illustrate the ideas I have in store. The project I work on is a step forward to mastering 3D art, slowly bringing me closer to being able to express my creative vision that brings together fantasy, reality, tradition, and individuality.</p>

      <p>“Carol’s Dreamscape” is an immersive dive into memory, guilt, and the fraying edges of self—a trip into the subconscious mind of an archaeologist whose search for the past in her professional life reflects a search for the past in her own psyche. Existing in the dreamscape that is constructed in Dungeon Alchemist and extended in 3D sculpture, “Carol’s Dreamscape” is supposed to blur the line between imaginary concepts and something visual. The story tracks the character of Carol, an archaeological researcher with links to the Archaeological Institute of America, in a daydreamlike state where she explores an imagined life.</p>
