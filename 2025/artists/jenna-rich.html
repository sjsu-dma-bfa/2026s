      <p>It’s difficult to overstate just how much of ourselves we put into our digital personas. So much of our identity is laid bare on the internet that it’s hard to accept that there is a disconnect between ourselves and our profiles. <em>disconnect</em> explores that disconnect. What happens when one’s digital identity changes faster than their physical one? And, if it does, when does the digital identity start influencing the physical? Who’s to say what’s real and what’s not through a computer screen? What happens when something breaks?

With <em>disconnect</em>, my intention is to explore the evolution and discovery of my own personal identity through a fictionalized and metaphorical lens. I’m very much still in the process of becoming myself; <em>disconnect</em> places the user in a similar position, and in touch with another entity that was lost along the way. Using puzzles, encryption and decryption, and glitches, I hope to express to the end user a part of how it feels to be disconnected.</p>
