      <p>Lots of people want and like living a quiet life or even the same day over and over again because it is the best feeling. Every day feels the same: being happy with friends, filled with laughter, and with no problems at all throughout the day. I’m one of those people. I have the same specific routine I follow each day. I wake up, get ready to go out, go to class, and then hang out with my friends. My friends always see me as the chill and energetic guy, but what they don’t see is something toxic and locked up. Sometimes things don't go according to plan, and the day becomes different. In the back of my mind, I hear thoughts that become too loud. They’re not great ones either. My smile begins to break down and so does my mind. Scared that my friends will find a darker side of me, I isolate myself so I don’t lash out. I try to hide the cracks, but eventually something slips out and explodes. It leaves a lingering scene that replays, making me break down and feel like I’m going insane. But then I wake up, from a dream that felt real.</p>
