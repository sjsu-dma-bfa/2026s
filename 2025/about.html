      <p>Ctrl_Dystopia is the BFA exhibition led by twenty-one graduating Digital Media Art students in Fall 2025. During this showcase, each student will have the opportunity to express their skills and passion through an original artwork that reflects their individual identity and creativity. The exhibition will be held on November 15, 2025, at the Hammer Theatre Center from 6–9 PM.

        The BFA in Digital Media Art program allows students to explore the intersection of art and technology. Students learn to use code, design, and visual storytelling to create interactive digital works. Throughout the program, they develop both artistic vision and technical production skills through a variety of projects, both in and outside the classroom. With guidance from dedicated Digital Media Art faculty, students refine their portfolios through solo or collaborate exhibitions, internships, and professional experiences that prepare them for careers in the ever-evolving field of digital arts.</p>
